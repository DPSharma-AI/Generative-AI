    "#### Making Class Instances Behave Like Functions Using __call__():\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, classes can be designed such that their instances can be called like regular functions. This is achieved by implementing the special method __call__() in the class. When you call an instance of the class, Python internally calls the __call__() method, passing any arguments given to the instance as if it were a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In LangChain, the __call__() method can be particularly useful when you're working with chains of functions or objects, allowing you to compose objects or operations seamlessly. When dealing with chains in LangChain, you'll often need to call objects (or components) in a sequence, making the __call__() method a useful tool for implementing behavior that resembles function calls."
